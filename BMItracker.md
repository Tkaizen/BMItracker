Welcome to the BMI Tracker!
Your Body Mass Index (BMI) is an important tool for assessing whether you're in a healthy weight range based on your height and weight. The BMI tracker helps you monitor your BMI over time, giving you a clear picture of your overall health.
Why Track Your BMI?
Health Insight: BMI provides insight into your risk for various health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. By keeping track of your BMI, you can take proactive steps to maintain or achieve a healthy weight.
Set Goals: Whether you're aiming to lose weight, gain muscle, or maintain your current health, tracking your BMI can help you set realistic goals and monitor progress.
Personalized Adjustments: Regular updates to your BMI can prompt you to adjust your exercise routine, diet, or lifestyle to better suit your health needs.
How Does BMI Work?
BMI is calculated using the formula:
BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) × Height (m)).
A normal BMI typically ranges from 18.5 to 24.9. A BMI outside this range may indicate underweight, overweight, or obesity, which may require lifestyle adjustments or consultations with a healthcare provider.

Your Path to Better Health:
Tracking your BMI isn't just about numbers—it's about taking control of your health and making informed decisions for a longer, happier life. Stay consistent, stay motivated, and let your BMI tracker be a useful tool on your wellness journey.
